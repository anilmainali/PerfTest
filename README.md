What is Performance Testing?
Software performance testing is a means of quality assurance (QA). It involves testing software applications to ensure they will perform well under their expected workload.

Features and Functionality supported by a software system is not the only concern. A software application's performance like its response time, do matter. The goal of performance testing is not to find bugs but to eliminate performance bottlenecks
The focus of Performance testing is checking a software program's

Speed - Determines whether the application responds quickly
Scalability - Determines maximum user load the software application can handle.
Stability - Determines if the application is stable under varying loads
