## Performance Testing running notes:

### Introduction : 
##### What is Performance Testing?
Performance Testing is testing an application to validate the 
- Speed
- Scabilility
- Stability

under virtual user load in production like environment with the intention of meeting Non-Functional requirement.

Here the speed means the transactions response time.[TRT] we have to calculate the transaction response time for each of those transaction.

#### What is Transaction?
whenever the request is sent and you get a response for that request we call that as a transaction.

For example: 

- Login Transaction
- Search Transaction 
- Add to cart transaction
- Check out transaction
- Log out transaction.

So we have to calculate the response time for each Transaction.And compare it to what it should be according to the SLA.If it is within the SLA thats great but if it does not meet the SLA then you as a performance tester have to figure out why it is taking more than the SLA.or find the issues with the application under test or find the bottleneck.
